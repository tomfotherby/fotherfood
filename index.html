Version: FotherFood v0.2 (10/Jan/2009)
Softwara License: GNU Affero General Public License v3+

Feature List:
   1. List of 12 recipes
   2. Buttons to add recipes to a shopping list.
   3. Buttons to add regular shopping items to the shopping list (e.g. milk, bread, eggs, etc).
   4. Tracks the number of portions of each recipe in the shopping list.
   5. Each recipe has a "More Info" drop-down icon to display recipe details.
   6. Identical ingredients are summed together in the shopping list and different units are handled.
   7. The shopping list is sorted alphabetically by ingredients and by category of the ingredient (e.g. baking, fruit, etc).
    7b. The shoppin list ignores ingredients that we don't need to buy (e.g. water)
   8. Print mode - Only shows what's in the current shopping list (not every recipe). 

Technical Details:
   1. Free software (Affero General Public License)
   2. Written in Javascript (plus HTML,CSS and XML obviously)
   3. Recipes are read from a XML file which means no source code needs to be edited when adding new recipes.

ToDo List: 
 * Make it work on IE 6&7.
 * Work out how to do Eggs as a regular item and Eggs as an ingredient.
 * Work out prep+cooking and prep&cooking time.
 * Allow optional ingredients: Coriander in Spicy Spinach Cannelloni.
 * Work out how to do a "light" version of a item. e.g. light condensed milk.
 * Work out how to do alternative ingredients. E.g. Tagliatelle instead of Bucatini in Mushroom Carbonara.
 * Break recipies into a Main and Dessert section.
 * For Future releases:
  * Have a Tesco Express CSS - No titles, no units
  * Include a pic of each recipe
  * Give each recipe a price 
  * Have method for searching for quick recipes or cheap recipes
  * Link with Tesco.com to automatically add to shopping basket
